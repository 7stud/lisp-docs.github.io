title: About Common Lisp Docs
sidebar_position: 0

The goal of this page is to make it easier for new (and experienced) Lisp users to navigate through Common Lisp Documentation by both making the already existing documentation easier to navigate and by developing new documentation.

Based on the [Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/) there are 4 types of documentation:

* Tutorials
* How To Guides
* Explanations
* References

We want to categorize and provide all types of Common Lisp Documentation.

Please help us and contribute to our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/lisp-docs/lisp-docs.github.io).
