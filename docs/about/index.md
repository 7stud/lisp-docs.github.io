The goal of this page is to make it easier for new (and experienced) Lisp users to navigate through Common Lisp Documentation by both making the already existing documentation easier to navigate and by developing new documentation.

Based on the [Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/) there are 4 types of documentation:

* Tutorials: **complete** example driven explanation of how to program in Common Lisp
* How To Guides: using the Common Lisp ecosystem to program different applications
* Explanations: Conceptual and Technical explanations of concepts behind the working and design of Common Lisp
* References: a **complete** Technical Reference explaining the usage of all aspects of Common Lisp

We want to categorize and provide all types of Common Lisp Documentation.

Please help us and contribute to our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/lisp-docs/lisp-docs.github.io).
