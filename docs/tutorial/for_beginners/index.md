# Common Lisp for Beginner Programmers

The goal of this tutorial is to teach the concepts clearly with tons of examples. Beyond that, reading and referencing the [Technical Reference](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/) will provide more depth.

Alternatively to this tutorial, you can read for **free** any of the following books:

- [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/)
- [On Lisp by Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html)
- [ANSI Common Lisp also by Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/acl.html)

Here's a more exhaustive list of books for learning Common Lisp from [Cliki.net](https://cliki.net/Lisp%20books)
