# Structuring Projects

This section will explain:

- What are packages and systems?
  - [A short general introduction](/docs/tutorial/projects/packages-systems)
  - [In depth guide of packages in common lisp](/docs/tutorial/projects/guide_to_packages)
- How to structure your software projects?
  - The two most common apporaches to structure large projects:
    - The [more traditional way](/docs/tutorial/projects/structuring_large_projects) of writing protocols or multiple modules
    - The [package inferred way](/docs/tutorial/projects/package_inferred) which is conceptually more similar to other languages

Take a look at the How To Guide on [Structuring A Large caveman2 Project](/docs/howto/large-caveman/) for an example of the above.
