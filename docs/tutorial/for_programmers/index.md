# Common Lisp for Experienced Programmers

The goal of this tutorial is to teach the concepts clearly with tons of examples. Beyond that, reading and referencing the [Technical Reference](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/) will provide more depth.

The main concepts to learn for C, Java, or Python Programmers are:

- Symbols
- The Package System
- The CL Object System
- Macros
- The Condition System
- Use of First Class Functions

Alternatively to this tutorial, you can read for **free** any of the following books:

- [Practical Common Lisp](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/)
- [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming](https://norvig.github.io/paip-lisp/#/)
  - Source and Code Source https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp
