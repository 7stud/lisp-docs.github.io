# Tutorial Introduction

The goal of the tutorial is to provide an example drive explanation of the language to hit the ground running quickly. The [Technical Reference](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/) should be reviewed for a more definite and technically correct explanation of any concept, symbol, operator, or facet of the language. Additionally we have a list of recommended books for both [beginner programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_beginners/) and [experienced programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_programmers/).

So far the only sections of the tutorial written are those on:

- [Macros](/docs/tutorial/macros.md)
- [Packages](/docs/tutorial/guide_to_packages.md)

Please help us write this tutorial! You can even contribute content from the Public Domain or with Copyright permissions.
