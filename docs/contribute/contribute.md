## How To Contribute

Please just do a regular contribution on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lisp-docs/lisp-docs.github.io).

Note that for the Technical Reference we have a [different repository](https://github.com/lisp-docs/cl-language-reference).

Please see [this page for What To Contribute To The Technical Reference](/docs/contribute/reference-contribute).

## What To Contribute

Any explanations and writing that you write yourself, or you have the copyright to use.

If you add material someone else wrote for which you have permission, please add a note like you can see in [this example](http://localhost:3000/docs/tutorial/guide_to_packages).

The main thing to contribute to the main docs right now is on the [Tutorial](https://github.com/lisp-docs/lisp-docs.github.io/tree/main/docs).

We also need help writing the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started), [FAQs](/docs/faq), and the [Why Lisp](/docs/whylisp) pages for beginners and CTOs.

Please feel free to fill the pages with content. Ideally it should be example driven to make it beginner friendly and interactive. We can get inspiration for writing user friendly tutorials from other languages, however be careful to not follow them to closely as to not violate any copyrights and to also make the tutorial appropriate for Common Lisp.

## Project Source

The project is written in [Extended Markdown Syntax](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

First see the regular [Markdown Syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/). Markdown is very similar to simple text. In Extended Markdown `<`, `>`, `{`, and `}` are reserved and you can use React. For any other details see the [link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).
