# LISP Docs

## How To Contribute

Please just do a regular contribution on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lisp-docs/lisp-docs.github.io). Note that for the Technical Reference we have a [different repository](https://github.com/lisp-docs/cl-language-reference).

## What To Contribute

The main thing to contribute right now is on the [Tutorial](https://github.com/lisp-docs/lisp-docs.github.io/tree/main/docs).

Please feel free to fill the pages with content. Ideally it should be example driven to make it beginner friendly and interactive. I'm using the Python Tutorial as an example of a successfull tutorial.

Right Now we are building the Technical Reference from the original ANSI Draft TeX sources. When we are finished with that we would like to add examples to every page to make it easier to understand. However, the actual text of the reference should not be editted much.
