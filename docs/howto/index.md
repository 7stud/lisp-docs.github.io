# How To Guides

The goal of this section is to provide a guided tutorial of developing a project from **start to finish** (which may include deploying) of a project using the Common Lisp Ecosystem.

Here are some ideas for How to Guides:

- A To Do web application using Hunchentoot, a database, a basic front end, some routing library, and a html template library. [Here's a starting point](/docs/howto/webdev-hunchentoot/).
- A To Do web application similar to the one above except using caveman2 and maybe some ajax functionality with json routes
- An embedded application
- A game using some library
- A game using Shinmera's library, or a walk through of Kandria's source code
