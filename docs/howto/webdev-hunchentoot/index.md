# A To Do Web Application using Hunchentoot

:::warning

This article is a stub, please help us by contributing!

:::

The goal of this guide is to make a To Do web application using:

- Hunchentoot
- a database
- a basic front end
- some routing library
- and a HTML template library

The guide will guide you through:

- Installing Common Lisp and other dependencies
- Starting the server for development
- Writing your first routes
- Integrating a Database
- Writing the controller logic
- Writing the HTML templates for the views
- Providing a basic css style for the application
- Finishing all the CRUD functionality of the app
- Deploying the application to a standalone executable that can be run in a server
- Configuring the domain, ssl, and others are optional but would be a nice cherry on top of the cake
