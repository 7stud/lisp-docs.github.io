The mission of Lisp Docs and this website in particular is to provide LISP Documentation.

The Docs in this Website are aimed to be a User Guide.

This website [CL LISP Reference](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/) is meant to be the reference.

We will hopefully soon come up with a tutorials website and more!

We aim to make this website as comprehensive as websites for other languages.

Adding some sample code below...

```lisp
(format T "Hello World!")
```

```lisp
    (defun my-sqr (x)
        (* x x))
```
